# CPP

## Git Repo for 42 CPP Module 00

### C++

is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an ex- tension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes" (source: Wikipedia).



The goal of these modules is to introduce you to Object-Oriented Programming.

This will be the starting point of your C++ journey. Many languages are recommended to learn OOP.

We decided to choose C++ since it’s derived from your old friend C.

Because this is a complex language, and in order to keep things simple, your code will comply with the C++98 standard.

We are aware modern C++ is way different in a lot of aspects. 

So if you want to become a proficient C++ developer, it’s up to you to go further after the 42 Common Core!

Welcome to the 80s and their unbelievable technology! Write a program that behaves
like a crappy awesome phonebook software.

## Exercise 02:
### The Job Of Your Dreams
Your manager just gave you some work to do. Your first task is to recreate a
lost file. Something went wrong and a source file was deleted by mistake. Unfortunately,
your colleagues don’t know what Git is and use USB keys to share code. At this point, it
would make sense to leave this place right now. However, you decide to stay. Challenge
accepted!
